Instead, they break into tiny pieces of \u2018microplastics\u2019 which can enter our food chains.\u00a0\u00a0These vapes may take a few days to finish, but their environmental harms stick around for a very, very long time. \u00a0\u00a0Say one \u2018disposable\u2019 vape promises about 600 puffs - its plastic casing will easily last for 600 years buried in the earth.\u00a0",

That's the equivalent of eight being thrown away per second. \u00a0\u00a0This is extremely wasteful of the valuable resources contained in these vapes, such as cobalt and copper. In 2022, the same group found that more than 40 tonnes of lithium were discarded in single-use vapes. This is the same amount used to power 5,000 electric vehicles. \u00a0\u00a0For the small number of single-use vapes which are sent for recycling, it\u2019s a difficult job, because they contain many chemical components and are not designed to be taken apart. They usually have to be disassembled by hand \u2013 a slow and tricky process which struggles to match the avalanche of vapes that are produced and discarded. \u00a0\u00a0The lithium-ion batteries in these vapes can also cause fires, which risks the safety of waste management workers, firefighters and the public. \u00a0\u00a0In 2023 there were over 1,200 battery fires in bin lorries and waste sites across the UK -\u00a0 a 70% increase on the year before.
