That\u2019s why we wanted to use this event to bring together developers from across government to share best practices and highlight what works and what still needs to be improved.\u00a0Important to this was making sure we could drive home the message to senior leaders - that supporting digital delivery should be a top priority, and that this can be accelerated by supporting industry best practice and ways of working for software engineering.The day was only made possible by our generous sponsors: GovCamp and Government Digital Service (GDS). In the spirit of sustainability and accessibility, we made sure that the conference was a low-budget event with topics crowd-sourced from community coordinators.As a result of everyone\u2019s efforts, the conference was met with such incredible enthusiasm that tickets sold out.We structured the day of the event itself to allow time for detailed subject talks and case study presentations.

The end of March saw an important milestone as the seven CERSIs came together for the first time to discuss their goals, challenges and ways of working.
